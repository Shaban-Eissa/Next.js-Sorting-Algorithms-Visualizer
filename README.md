# Sorting Visualizer

A powerful sorting visualizer built with **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **TailwindCSS**. This app provides an interactive visualization of various sorting algorithms with adjustable speed, making it an excellent tool for understanding sorting techniques and computer science fundamentals.

## Features

- **Sorting Algorithms**: Supports multiple algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.
- **Adjustable Speed**: Control the speed of the sorting visualization.
- **Responsive Design**: Clean and responsive UI built with TailwindCSS.
- **Real-time Visualization**: Step-by-step visualization of how sorting algorithms work.
- **Animations**: Smooth transitions and animations to enhance the user experience.

## Built With

- [Next.js 14 (App Router)](https://nextjs.org/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
